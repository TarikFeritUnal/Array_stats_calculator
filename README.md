# Number Statistics Calculator

This is a simple Java console application that:
- Calculates the **average**
- Finds the **maximum**
- Finds the **minimum**  
of a list of numbers entered by the user.

## 💡 How It Works

The user is asked how many numbers they want to enter. After entering the numbers one by one, the program calculates and displays the average, maximum, and minimum values.

## 🧪 Example

```
How many numbers will you enter? 5
Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 25
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 17
Enter a number: 8
Average: 12.6
Maximum: 25.0
Minimum: 3.0
```
